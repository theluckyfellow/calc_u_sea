# Calc_U_Sea
A calculator for learning and playing with numbers

# Technology
This is a Javascript project and uses the p5.js library. It works for different browsers and screen sizes. The code is not very well documented at the moment, but that should change as it develops.

# To do
This project is not complete. A list of planned features is as follows
-Fix the logic holes... "beta testers" have found a few
-add animations
-add properties to the objects (instead of only balls, we could have dogs, flowers, water, or whatever)
-make game elements and challenges
-make it collaborative online
